      "  - Home Runs (HR): 29\n",
      "  - Runs Batted In (RBI): 102\n",
      "  - Slugging Percentage (SLG): Information on SLG was not directly provided but given his AVG and HR, it would be indicative of a strong slugging percentage.\n",

      "  - Runs Batted In (RBI): 107\n",
      "  - Slugging Percentage (SLG): Details on SLG were not provided, however, given his AVG, HR, and RBI, his slugging performance is highly impressive.\n",

      "  - Runs Batted In (RBI): 86\n",
      "  - Slugging Percentage (SLG): Although specific SLG was not cited, a .268 AVG with 28 HRs suggests a solid contribution to his team's slugging.\n",

      "Based on the information gathered, identifying the fourth key player for the Nationals based on the 2023 season's performance points to **Kyle Finnegan** as a significant contributor, especially from a pitching perspective. While the request was for batting statistics and Finnegan is a pitcher, his mention alongside Lane Thomas in terms of yearly awards indicates his importance to the Nationals. However, specific batting statistics for another player were not found, suggesting Finnegan's impact from a pitching standpoint was noteworthy for the Nationals in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your request was for a batter, and the available data points to pitchers and players already mentioned, we'd need to consider the impact of players like CJ Abrams mentioned as exciting to watch in 2023, or look closely at the performances of other batters in the Nationals lineup for the comprehensive analysis.
