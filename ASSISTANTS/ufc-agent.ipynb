      "**Performance Trends:**\n",
      "Cannonier has maintained a consistent striking accuracy and defensive capability across his last five fights. His ability to land significant strikes remains strong, though he absorbs a notable amount of strikes per minute, which could be a concern against a strong counter-striker.\n",

Cannonier's experience and knockout power make him a formidable opponent, but Imavov's superior defensive skills and lower absorption rate might give him an advantage in a prolonged fight. The key for Cannonier will be to leverage his power striking to overcome Imavov's defenses, while Imavov will need to maintain his composure and utilize his precision and tactical acumen to control the pace and distance of the fight.\u001b[0m\n",
